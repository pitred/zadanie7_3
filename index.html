      <h3>- verse one -</h3>
      <p>A nightmare of you <br>
        Of death in the pool <br>
        Wakes me up at quarter to three <br>
        I'm lying on the floor of the night before <br>
        With a stranger lying next to me <br>
        A nightmare of you <br>
        Of death in the pool <br>
        I see no further now than this dream <br>
        The trembling hands of the trembling man <br>
        Hold my mouth <br>
        To hold in a scream</p>

      <h3>- verse two -</h3>
      <p>I try to think <br>
        To make it slow <br>
        If only here is where I go <br>
        If this is real <br>
        I have to see <br>
        I turn on fire <br>
        And next to me... <br>
        It looks good! <br>
        It tastes like nothing on earth <br>
        It looks good! <br>
        It tastes like nothing on earth <br>
        Its so smooth it even feels like skin <br>
        It tells me how it feels to be new</p>
