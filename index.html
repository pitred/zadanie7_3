      <h3>- verse one -</h3>
      <p>A nightmare of you
         Of death in the pool
         Wakes me up at quarter to three
         I'm lying on the floor of the night before
         With a stranger lying next to me
         A nightmare of you
         Of death in the pool
         I see no further now than this dream
         The trembling hands of the trembling man
         Hold my mouth
         To hold in a scream</p>
