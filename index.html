        <h3>- verse one -</h3>
        <p>A nightmare of you
           Of death in the pool
           Wakes me up at quarter to three
           I'm lying on the floor of the night before
           With a stranger lying next to me
           A nightmare of you
           Of death in the pool
           I see no further now than this dream
           The trembling hands of the trembling man
           Hold my mouth
           To hold in a scream</p>

      <div class="verse_two">
        <h3>- verse two -</h3>
        <p>I try to think
           To make it slow
           If only here is where I go
           If this is real
           I have to see
           I turn on fire
           And next to me...
           It looks good!
           It tastes like nothing on earth
           It looks good!
           It tastes like nothing on earth
           Its so smooth it even feels like skin
           It tells me how it feels to be new</p>
